# Collectors-Haven 

An app for the gamer and game collector, Collectors-Haven allows you to search for games that your are interested in buying. You can also use our search features to get info about the current value of your game, and the value over time. Make a collection of all of your favorite games and more.

# Purpose
Built this app to test our Html, Css and Javascript skills. The app also uses the materialize framework and multiple Third-Party Api's. We then transformed our site into the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app using the technologies listed below.
